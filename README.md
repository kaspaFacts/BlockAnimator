# BlockAnimator
Create Animations using PyGame and Output to MP4 using OpenCV

Currently an empty skeleton for using pygame to build animations and output to mp4 using OpenCV

To run a demo, check what demo will be run at the bottom of demo.py, comment out any you do not wish to run, then run demo.py directly(in pycharm, right-click on demo.py and "Run"), a new mp4 video will be generated in the same folder next to demo.py

stress test - FiftyBlocksDemo (creates 50 blocks, spaced along the coord grid, with connections to 9 previous blocks, moves from grid position to circular arrangement, then moves back to grid arrangement while half of the blocks fade opacity to 30%, and the other half change to green, while connections remain updated to each block)

NOTE: when viewing animations in a media player(and sliding time), the media player will drop frames, but frames are rendered and exported to mp4
