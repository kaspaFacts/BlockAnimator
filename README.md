# BlockAnimator
Create Animations using PyGame and Output to MP4 using OpenCV

Currently an empty skeleton for using pygame to build animations and output to mp4 using OpenCV


Currently nothing with the title ghostdag is integrated.


Currently demo.py does not work as a github repo, demo was written for executing locally.


To run a demo, check what demo will be run at the bottom of demo.py, comment out any you do not wish to run, then run demo.py directly(in pycharm, right-click on demo.py and "Run"), a new mp4 video will be generated in the same folder next to demo.py
