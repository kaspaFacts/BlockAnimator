# BlockAnimator
Create Animations using PyGame and Output to MP4 using OpenCV

Currently an empty skeleton for using pygame to build animations and output to mp4 using OpenCV


Currently nothing with the title ghostdag is integrated.  BlockDAG is untested


To run a demo, check what demo will be run at the bottom of demo.py, comment out any you do not wish to run, then run demo.py directly(in pycharm, right-click on demo.py and "Run"), a new mp4 video will be generated in the same folder next to demo.py


FiftyBlocksDemo takes less than 1 second to generate 240p at 15 FPS, and 63 sec to generate 1080p at 60FPS # TODO, update for more multiple animations tunning simultaniously


NOTE: only the functions in the demo have been tested with the rendering and updated coord system and the updated timing system
